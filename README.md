# Objective 

This project is to create a dashboard for the New York Citi Bike Program. 

# Data Source 

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

# Visualizations 

Use the visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena and a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
