# Data Source 

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Visualizations 
Use the visulizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena and a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with xip code data overlaid on top.
